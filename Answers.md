<body>
<ol>
<li>State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)</li>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Definition Language (DDL):</b>
Used to define the structure of the database, including creating, altering, and dropping database objects like tables, indexes, and views.</li>

<li><b>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</b>
Used to manipulate the data within the database, such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.</li>

<li><b>Data Control Language (DCL):</b>
Used to control access to the database, including granting and revoking privileges to users.

<li><b>Query Processor:</b>
Responsible for interpreting and executing user queries, optimizing query execution plans, and generating results.</li>

<li><b>Storage Manager:</b>
Handles the physical storage of data on the disk, including managing storage space, indexing, and data recovery.</li>

<li><b>Transaction Manager:</b>
Ensures that database transactions are processed correctly and atomically, even in the event of system failures.</li>

<li><b>Security Manager:</b>
Implements security measures to protect the database from unauthorized access and data breaches.</li>

<li><b>Concurrency Control Manager:</b>
Prevents data inconsistency when multiple users access and modify the database concurrently.<li>
    
    <li><b>Metadata Manager:</b>
Stores and manages information about the database schema, including table definitions, indexes, and user privileges.</li>

<li><b>User Interface:</b>
Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the DBMS, allowing users to execute queries, create reports, and manage the database.</li>
</ul>
<li>State and Explain three classifications of SQL?</li>
<ul>
    <li><b>Procedural SQL:</b>
        This type of SQL is used to specify the steps to be taken to perform a task, such
        as executing a stored procedure or a trigger. It is used to perform complex
        operations and is typically used in applications where the database is
        accessed through a programming language.</li>
        <li><b>Declarative SQL:</b>
            This type of SQL is used to specify what is to be done, rather than how it
            is to be done. It is used to define the structure of the database and
            is typically used in applications where the database is accessed through
            a query language.</li>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented SQL:</b>
                This type of SQL is used to define and manipulate objects in a database.
                It is used to create and manage complex data structures and is typically
                used in applications where the database is accessed through an object-oriented
                programming language.</li>
</ul>

<li>What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?</li>
<p>
    A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, while a foreign key is a
    field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The primary key
    uniquely identifies each row in a table, while the foreign key establishes a relationship
    between two tables.
</p>

<li>What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?</li>
<p>
    An entity-relationship diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the relationships between entities in
    a database. It shows the entities, attributes, and relationships between them, and is used to
    design and communicate the structure of a database.
</p>

<li>What are the advantages of relational databases?</li>
<p>
    Relational databases have several advantages, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Improved data integrity</li>
        <li>Enhanced data security</li>
        <li>Improved data sharing and collaboration</li>
        <li>Increased scalability and flexibility</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<li>State four types of data type used to store data in tables?</li>
<ul>
    <li><b>Integer:</b> This data type is used to store whole numbers,
        such as 1, 2, 3, etc.</li>
        <li><b>String:</b> This data type is used to store text data,
            such as names, addresses, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Boolean:</b> This data type is used to store true or false
                values.</li>
                <li><b>DateTime:</b> This data type is used to store date and time
                    values.</li>
</ul>

<li>What is the f a database management system (DBMS)?</li>
<p>
    A database management system (DBMS) is a software system that enables you to define, create
    and manage databases for various applications. It provides a way to store, modify, and retrieve data
    in a database.
